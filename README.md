# capstone-cust-churn
Hello,

This file contains the set of instructions for training ML models for Customer churn data set and executing the chosen ML model on unseen test data set.
Below is the list of components to start with -

1) churn_train.csv # File used for training & validating different ML models
2) churn_test.csv # File used for testing the unseen data with chosen ML model 
3) Dileep_Koneru_Capstone_Customer_Churn_Train_Validate.ipynb # Python program that contains detailed steps for pre-processing the data & choosing the optimal ML model
4) Dileep_Koneru_Capstone_Customer_Churn_Predict.ipynb # Python program that runs against the Test data set for providing predictions
5) *.pkl # Different pickle files for different Trained ML models

Instructions for executing #

1) Download all the above mentioned files into a single location
2) Execute the program # Dileep_Koneru_Capstone_Customer_Churn_Predict.ipynb to get the predictions from the file - churn_test.csv
